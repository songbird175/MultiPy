# MultiPy
(Hopefully) a package that will simplify function usage and understanding within Multivariable Calculus. Built while taking/in an attempt to better understand a course on the subject.

## Current uses
Vector class initializes a vector instance in three dimensions. Magnitude and direction are Vector attributes. Vectors can be initialized with only 2 arguments; the third component is assumed to be zero.

Available methods are vector addition, vector subtraction, scalar multiplication, dot product, cross product, and triple scalar product.

Other functions: determine if two vectors are scalar multiples; find a vector based on magnitude and theta; find the angle between two vectors; find the projection of one vector onto another; find the projection of one vector onto another based on the angle between them; find the magnitude of cross product given vector magnitudes and theta

New class for parametric equations. Cannot find the intersection of two lines; can manipulate parametric properties
