# MultiPy
(Hopefully) a package that will simplify function usage and understanding within Multivariable Calculus. Built while taking/in an attempt to better understand a course on the subject.

## Current uses
Vector class initializes a vector instance in three dimensions. Magnitude and direction are Vector attributes. Vectors can be initialized with only 2 arguments; the third component is assumed to be zero. Other Vector attributes include scalar multiplication, whether or not two vectors are parallel, and vector projection given an angle theta.

Available methods are vector addition, vector subtraction, dot product, cross product, and triple scalar product.

Other functions: find a vector based on magnitude and theta; find the angle between two vectors; find the projection of one vector onto another; find the magnitude of cross product given vector magnitudes and theta

New class for parametric equations. Cannot find the intersection of two lines; can manipulate parametric properties

New class for planes. Axes intercepts, as well as the general equation for the plane, are class attributes

New class for vector-valued functions. Can now visualize a curve in 3D space, take the derivative, and check if a function is continuous at a point
